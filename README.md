# Food Mood

Food Mood is a web application that uses your current location and selfie to suggest a nearby restaurant!

I build this web app from scratch using React.js, Node.js and Express.js. It's an ERN stack! For determining the mood from the photo, I used Amazon Rekognition, and for determining the restaurant, I used Yelp's Fusion API. I manually deployed this app through an AWS EC2 instance and set up the security certificate. Currently setting up an AWS CodePipeline to automate future deployments.

#### This was originally built as an entry to Capital One's Software Engineering Summit challenge. You can check out the original project here: https://github.com/samuel-ping/Old-Food-Mood
