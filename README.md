# Food Mood

I build this web app from scratch using React.js, Node.js and Express.js. It's an ERN stack! I deployed this app through an AWS EC2 instance. Currently setting up a CodePipeline to automate future deployments.

#### This was originally built as an entry to Capital One's Software Engineering Summit challenge. You can check out the original project here: https://github.com/samuel-ping/Old-Food-Mood
